Topology with an intermediate well (3 stable points in all) which can be higher, lower or equal than final well but all lower than origin well. 
Transition occurs from highest well (origin) to the last well while going through an intermediate well.

Difference between third and first well kept at 2. The middle well is at -1,0,1 with respect to the last well. gamma = 1 kept constant in all cases.

Transition distances 2 (middle well) and 4 (final well)
